# DawesomeToolkit
A library for Processing

Dawesome Toolkit is a small collection of utilities that you may find useful day to day when creating work in Processing. They include some nice layout methods such as creating a grid, creating a Vogel spiral pattern as well as a simple approach to mapping things around a sphere. The included examples demonstrate the different parts of the library. Feedback greatly appreciated.
